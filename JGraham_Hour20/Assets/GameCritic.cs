/* Is the game too easy or hard?
 - I think that it's out of the book difficulty is too easy. I made various changes to ramp of the difficulty.

I changed the overall speed of which includes the players movement speed, the rate at which obstacles and powerups spawn. I also changed how much time you get from powerups and how much you loose from obstacles.

List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

- I think something that would give it a wow factor is changing the backround and adding a more detailed platform. 

What 2 parts of the game are fun? 

- I think the most fun parts are not hitting an obstacle streak and trying to see how long you can survive. 
I believe I mostly fixed this by tweaking the values of time gained and lost so you can't just keep hitting obstacles over and over and still gain time.

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
- I believe that one of the issues I fixed of being able to basically not loose because of how much time you gain from powerups.
as well as the overall speed of the game feeling monotonous. Both of these I feel I have fixed to the best of my ability. As well as fixing the powerup and obstacle model to be more unique.
