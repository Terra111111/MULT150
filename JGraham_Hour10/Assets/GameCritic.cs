/* Is the game too easy or hard? - I believe that multiple features I've introduced help to create 
a difficulty overtime effect. As with the chaos goal, there will be less chaos balls overtime and with
the imporved bumper shape, you are able to have a little more control over where you want to angle the 
balls. */

/* What would make it easier or harder? - There are many aspects that could increase the difficulty, for 
instance if you could make the bumper smaller, giving the player less control over if they are able to
influence the balls movement. You can, remove the chaos goal, add obtacles around the goals, add more 
chaos balls, reduce the players movement. However, all of these can also be removed to make the game easier.
One feature I added on my own was a trail system for each ball. I felt like while play testing it was
difficult to track some of the balls so adding a colored trail helped with that. */

/* What would give it that “wow” factor? - Personally for a game like this I think just adding more "chaos"
would give it a wow factor. When you load in and there's just a ton of stuff happening that it's almost 
overwhelming for a little. This would be reduced though to do the nature of it getting eaiser over time. */

/* What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious? - I felt like the most fun aspect
of the game was seeing the ball get the perfect trajectory and go right into the goal. However with the
basic game complete, while playtesting I couldn't get the blue ball in for a good 5 minutes due to luck.
I tried to add multiple systems that would reduce the overall time spent just waiting. The balls speed 
also greatly outpace the players speed, to fix this I increased the fps controller base speed by just a 
little. */



/* 4 Suggestions Implemented
- Added variation of chaos ball, the larger shape of it can disrupt multiple balls at the same time
- Chaos goal was added, located in the center of the field, this can reduce rng overtime.
- Adjusted the shape of the players bumper, the angles allow it to act more like bumpers and have 
more control over the where the player wants to ball to go while still having randomness.
- Changed the footstep audio to something that sounds like it's hovering, as everything is y 2 off the ground. */
