/* Here are the various settings I modifed for my particle system to keep the ball in the air for 
over 2 minutes. However it is random due to the nature of particles. 
- Startlifetime
- Prewarm
- Simulation space, not sure if this did anything in unity
- Emission changed to 200
- Shape, kept as cone but modified angle, radius, radius thickness
- Velocity over lifetime - adjusted obrital z and radial
- Size over lifetime using a basic curve
- Collision, editied dampen, bounce, max collision shapes, and collider force. 

Most of the time spent was tweaking the specific values needed to keep the ball in the air.
